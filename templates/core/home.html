        <h1>Welcome</h1>

        <p>
            This year the European Django community would like to welcome you all
            in the city of Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
        </p>
        <p>
            Amsterdam has been known throughout history as a city of
            open mindedness, tolerance and trade. And we hope we can show this
            by organising <em>a fabulous DjangoCon in the very heart of the city!</em>
        </p>

        <h1>Focus: Advanced topics</h1>
        <p>
            Amsterdam will be the successor to two amazing editions held
            earlier: <em>2009 in Prague</em> and<em>2010 in Berlin</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the years the Django framework has shown a definate growth
            to becoming a mature framework with a wealthy ecosystem of
            plugins and applications developed by many talented developers, like you.
        </p>
        <p>
            We want to honour this by organising a conference that focusses
            on advanced topics.
